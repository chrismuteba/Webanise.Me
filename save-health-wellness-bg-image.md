# Instructions for Saving the Health & Wellness Background Image

1. Save the modern healthcare facility image you provided to your project directory with the following details:

   - **Filename**: `health-wellness-bg.jpg`
   - **Location**: Save in the main project folder (c:/Users/mutebc/OneDrive - BDO LLP/Desktop/WFL/)
   - This is the same folder where your HTML files are located

2. The image should show the modern, clean healthcare facility with medical equipment and technology that you provided.

3. Once saved, the website will automatically display this image as the background for the Health & Wellness industry page.

## Verification

After saving the image, you can open the health-wellness-automation.html file in your browser to verify that the background image appears correctly.
